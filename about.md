The [Top 10 FAIR Data & Software Global Sprint](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2018/10/top-ten-fair-announcement/) was held online over the course of two-days (29-30 November 2018), where participants from around the world were invited to develop brief guides (stand alone, self paced training materials), called "Things", that can be used by the research community to understand FAIR in different contexts as well as some initial steps to consider. The idea for "Top 10 Data Things" stems from [initial work]((https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/10-medical-and-health-things)) done at the Australian Research Data Commons (formerly known as the Australian National Data Service) or ARDC.

The Global Sprint was organised by Library Carpentry, Australian Research Data Commons and the Research Data Alliance Libraries for Research Data Interest Group in collaboration with FOSTER Open Science, OpenAire, RDA Europe, Data Management Training Clearinghouse, California Digital Library, Dryad, AARNet, Center for Digital Scholarship at the Leiden University, and DANS. Anyone could join the Sprint and roughly 25 groups/individuals participated from The Netherlands, Germany, Australia, United States, Hungary, Norway, Italy, and Belgium.

Sprinters worked off of a [primer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TwJyButvAVEz5tCq_bdzD6kdKMvy0wiVLuE3uNbR7Bs/edit) that was provided in advance together with an online ARDC webinar introducing FAIR and the Sprint titled, "[Ready, Set, Go! Join the Top 10 FAIR Data Things Global Sprint](https://www.slideshare.net/AustralianNationalDataService/ready-set-go-join-the-top-10-fair-data-things-global-sprint)." Groups/individuals developed their Things in Google docs which could be accessed and edited by participants. The Sprinters also used a [Zoom channel](https://monash.zoom.us/j/944903353) provided by ARDC, for online calls and coordination, and a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Top10FAIR) provided by Library Carpentry to chat with each other throughout the two-days. In addition, participants used the Twitter hashtag [#Top10FAIR](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23Top10FAIR&src=typd) to communicate with the broader community, sometimes including images of the day. 

Participants welcomed each other throughout the Sprint and created an overall welcoming environment. As the Sprint shifted to different timezones it was a chance for participants to catch up. The Zoom and Gitter channels were a way for many to connect over FAIR but also discuss other topics. A number of participants did not know what to expect from a Library Carpentry/Carpentries-like event but found a welcoming environment where everyone could participate. 

The Top 10 FAIR Data & Software Things repository and site hosts the work of the Sprinters and is meant to be an evolving resource. Members of the wider community can submit issues and/or pull requests to the Things to help improve them. In addition, a published version of the Things will be made available via Zenodo in January 2019.
