## Description: 
This guide brings concepts surrounding FAIR data principles and the 23 (research data ) Things program to the archaeological research domain with the aim of fostering better data practices and stewardship throughout the discipline.

## Audience:
Researchers, scholars, students, volunteers, CRM, government employees- anyone working with or around data collected for archaeological research and management.

## How to use this guide
You don’t have to do all of the Things, and in fact, you may not be able to do every Thing. However, familiarize yourself with each Thing and implement those which suit your work and interests. Try to schedule time to learn more about a Thing regularly and work through how you could integrate it into your own research practices.

## Why this guide?
Archaeological data is costly to collect, difficult or impossible to re-collect, and frequently lacks the context or documentation to reuse. Despite this, the domain has not coalesced around standards yet although guidelines and data services are gaining traction. This guide helps introduce these services and calls out resources that can facilitate the adoption of best practices.

## After working through the 10 Things below you’ll know how to:
* to plan and prepare for data collections so that the data that are collected are FAIR
* document collection processing analyses to support FAIR data
* draft and refine a data model
* find training or data specialists that can assist you in your work
* identify the multiple roles in the interdisciplinary project
+ plan for a field season that integrates best practices for data management
* cite data, publish your data so that it can be cited, and why it is important to do so
* write a good data management plan
* identify the major data repositories in Archaeology
* reference the Guides to Good Practice and when to do so (at the start of a project and prior to collecting data!)
* evaluate tools that exist and can be used for humanities data
* use and appropriately link out the data (?)
Data in archaeology
varied types [textual, visual (raster, vector), tabular (spreadsheets, databases), spatial, audio, 3D]

# Things
## Thing 1: Understanding the lifecycle of research data
*Getting started*
Read 'Planning for the Creation of Digital Data’ in the Digital Antiquity Guides to Good Practice
Consider the types of data collected and used within your own work. How many file formats do you work with regularly? How many files have become inaccessible to you over the years? To your colleagues or collaborators?
*Learn more*
Watch the short film describing the lifecycle of research data at https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/lifecycle
Map out the lifecycle of data on your most recent project. What processes and workflows have gotten you to the stage you are at currently? What can you do to facilitate the ongoing use and reuse of your data?
*Challenge me*
Read ‘Project Documentation’ and 'Project Metadata’  in the Digital Antiquity Guides to Good Practice
Draft documentation for your most recent project or a forthcoming project. Include information about the background, methodology employed or to be employed, a narrative on the site and its context (historically, archaeologically, culturally, etc). This documentation will not only facilitate the eventual dissemination of your data but also any proposals or publications about the work itself.
Review the metadata for this project, document in a single location what metadata you currently record or plan to record and compare it to the metadata tables at http://guides.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/g2gp/CreateData_1-2. Are you missing any Project Metadata? File-Level Metadata (general and technical)? How can you fill in any gaps?
## Thing 2: Preservation
*Getting started*
Browse the websites for archaeological data repositories and preservation services (Archaeology Data Service, tDAR, Open Context).
Identify which service(s) contain data of interest to your work. Get familiar searching the services.
Read ‘Why Deposit Data’ (http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/deposit/Why.xhtml) and consider what is significant about your data, what requirements you need to meet, and which reasons resonate with your work and beliefs.
*Learn more*
Dig into the deposit instructions and criteria for each repository and service and identify which is the best fit for your own data.
Contact the service and discuss your project and data with them. Document their recommendations and determine how you can update your current workflow to support deposit.
*Challenge me*
Select a dataset you can deposit and go through the process of depositing in a repository
## Thing 3: Training and guides
*Getting started*
*Learn more*
*Challenge me*
Attend a workshop or conference on data and scholarly communication such as FORCE11 ...
## Thing 4: Data Management Plan (DMP) tools
*Getting started*
Data Management Plans
Review the guidelines for DMPs from funding agencies you are considering or have applied to in the past: NEH, NSF, AIA, etc (look up and link to)
*Learn more*
Check if your institution is participating in the DMP Tool (meaning they have customized the tool to point to institutional resources and services) at https://dmptool.org/public_orgs
Read through publicly available DMPs and consider what makes them strong/weak. Take notes on what aspects are important to include when writing your own (https://dmptool.org/public_plans)
*Challenge me*
Use a DMP Tool to create a DMP for a project you are currently working on or planning to start.
Ask a data librarian or specialist at your institution to review your DMP.
## Thing 5: Describing data
*Getting started*
Learn more about metadata schema, controlled vocabularies and why describing data is a good practice. Read ‘What are Metadata Standards’ from the Digital Curation Center (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/briefing-papers/standards-watch-papers/what-are-metadata-standards) and ‘Preparing Datasets - Metadata’ from ADS (http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/advice/PreparingDatasets.xhtml#Metadata0
Consider your current metadata practices- do they follow any schema or incorporate any vocabularies? Are your metadata fields described and documented explicitly?
*Learn more*
Review some of the vocabularies and thesauri related to archaeological data including Getty Vocabularies (http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/index.html), Perio.dO (http://perio.do/en/),
Consider whether these vocabularies could be incorporated into your data practices and workflow
*Challenge me*
Create a data dictionary (metadata field, type, definition, controlled vocabulary status) for a current or future project based on the metadata recommendations in the Guides to Good Practice.
Do this for each type of data you plan to or have collected that has an associated Guide (i.e. Raster images, Geophysics, GIS)
## Thing 6: Cleaning, processing, and documentation
*Getting started*
Learn about processing and documentation in ‘Data Selection: Preservation Intervention Points’ (http://guides.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/g2gp/ArchivalStrat_1-3)
Consider your own workflow and the different stages at which your data is transformed. Write down the equipment and instruments you use to collect data and the process for obtaining the data from those instruments (i.e. calibrating, exporting)
*Learn more*
Investigate tools that facilitate data cleaning and documentation such as Open Refine (http://guides.archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/g2gp/ArchivalStrat_1-3)
Attend a workshop or go through a tutorial to learn how to use the tool and its features including exporting out the record of the cleaning, etc
*Challenge me*
