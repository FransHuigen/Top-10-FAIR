## Description:
To translate FAIR principles into useable concepts for research-facing support staff (eg librarians).

## Audience:
Library staff who provide research support

## Goals:
* Translating FAIR speak to library speak (What is it? Why do I need to know it? What do I tell researchers?)
* Preparation for those water cooler conversations when librarians have to explain/advocate in favour of FAIR.
* Understanding FAIR data helps librarians be better stewards of organisational or community resources. 

# Things

### Thing 1: Why should librarians care about FAIR? 
There’s a lot of hype about the FAIR Data Principles. But why should librarians care? For starters, libraries have a strong tradition in describing resources, providing access and building collections, and providing support for the long-term stewardship of digital resources. Building on their specific knowledge and expertise, librarians should feel confident with making research data FAIR. So how can you and your library get started with the FAIR principles? 

**Activity:**  
1. Read LIBER’s *Implementing FAIR Principles: the role of Libraries* at [https://libereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LIBER-FAIR-Data.pdf](https://libereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LIBER-FAIR-Data.pdf) (5 minute read)

**Consider:**  
* Where is your library at in regard to the section on ‘getting started with FAIR’? 
* Where are you at in your own understanding of the FAIR Data Principles?

### Thing 2: How FAIR are your data?
The FAIR Principles are easily understood in theory but more challenging when applied in practice. In this exercise, you will be using the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) Data self-assessment tool to assess the 'FAIRness' of one of your library’s datasets.

**Activity:**  
1. Select a metadata record from your library’s collection (e.g. your institutional repository) that describes a published dataset.
2. Open the ARDC FAIR Data Assessment tool at [https://www.ands-nectar-rds.org.au/fair-tool](https://www.ands-nectar-rds.org.au/fair-tool) and run your chosen dataset against the tool to assess its ‘FAIRness’.

**Consider:**  
How FAIR was your chosen dataset?
How easy was it to apply the FAIR criteria to your dataset?
What things need to happen in order to improve the ‘FAIRness’ of your chosen dataset?

**Want more?**  
Try your hand at other tools like the [CSIRO 5 star data rating tool](https://doi.org/10.4225/08/5a12348f8567b) and the [DANS FAIR data assessment tool](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fairdat). 

### Thing 3: Do you teach FAIR to your researchers?
How FAIR aware are your researchers? Does your library incorporate FAIR into researcher training?

**Activity:**  
Go to existing data management/data sharing training you provide to Graduates, Higher Degree Researchers (HDRs) or other researchers. For example, review the [Duke Graduate School’s Responsible Conduct of Research topics page](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/responsible-conduct-research/rcr-topics).
Review how well the [15 FAIR Principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) are covered in this training and adjust accordingly.

### Thing 4: Is FAIR built into library practice and policy?
Your library may do a great job advocating the FAIR Data Principles to researchers but how well have the Principles been incorporated into library practice and policy? 

**Activity:**  
1. Review your library or institutional policies regarding research data management and digital preservation with the FAIR Principles in mind. Consider that in most cases library policy will have been written before the advent of FAIR. Are revisions required?
2. Review the data repository managed by your library. How well does it support FAIR Data?
3. Review your library’s Data Management Planning tool. Does it have features that support the FAIR Data Principles or are changes required?

### Thing 5: Are your library staff trained in FAIR?
Librarians can better support FAIR when they have been trained in what the Principles are and if they understand disciplinary metadata, vocabularies and tools to make data FAIR.

**Activity:**  
Conduct a skills and knowledge audit regarding FAIR with your library team. 
Based on the audit, identify gaps in FAIR skills and knowledge.
Design a training program that can fill the identified gaps. 

**Consider:**  
Reusing the wide range of openly available training materials available in the FAIR Data Principles e.g. you could [start here](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/fairdata/training). 

### Thing 6: Are digital libraries FAIR?
Criteria for determining if a digital library is FAIR:
* Persistent identifiers 
* Open access vs. paid access 
* Provenance information / metadata 
* Author credibility
* Versioning information 
* License / reuse information
* Usage statistics (number of times downloaded) 

**Activity:**  
1. Choose one of these digital libraries.
2. Search/browse for an item.
3. Does the library display reuse permissions/licenses on how to use the item?
4. Is there provenance information?
5. Instructions for use, creative/generative examples of collection use?

* [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
* [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/)
* [National Digital Library of India](https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/) 
* [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu)
* [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) 

### Thing 7: Does your library support FAIR metadata?
A number of FAIR principles make reference to “metadata”. What is metadata, how is it relevant to FAIR and does your library support the kind of metadata specified in the FAIR Data Principles?

**Activity:**  
1. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE) in which the Metadata Librarian explains metadata (3 mins)
2. Select three metadata records at random for datasets held in your library or repository collection.
3. Open the [checklist](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1065991) produced for use at the EUDAT summer school and see if you can check off those that reference metadata against the records you selected.
4. Make a list of what metadata elements could be improved in your library records to enable better support for FAIR.

### Thing 8: Does your library support FAIR identifiers?
Persistent identifiers are crucial for the findability and identification of research, researchers and for tracking impact metrics. The FAIR data principles call for open, standardised protocols for accessing data via a persistent identifier. So how well does your library support persistent identifiers?

**Activity:**  
1. Do your library systems support the identification of researchers via an ORCID? Do you authenticate against the ORCID registry?
2. Do your library systems, such as your institutional repository, support the issuing of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for research data and related materials?

**Consider:**  
* What other types of persistent identifiers do you think your library should support? Why or why not?

### Thing 9: Does your library support FAIR protocols?
For (meta)data to be accessible it should ideally be available via a standard protocol. Think in terms of borrowing a book: there are a number of expectations that the library lays out in order to proceed. You have to identify yourself using a library card, you have to bring the book to the checkout desk, and in return you walk out of the library with a demagnetised book and receipt reminding you when you have to return the book by. Accessing the books in the library means that you must learn and abide by the rules for accessing books. 

**Activity:**  
1. Does your library system or institutional repository use identifiers for records? If so what type?
2. Is there a way for you to query these systems to only retrieve the underlying metadata? If so, what method/s is/are used?
3. Is the library system or institutional repository you are using open, free, and used by other libraries?
4. Do you have to authenticate to access parts of the system? If so, what do you use? Is it used by other libraries?
5. Are there any other conditions/permissions needed to access metadata and resources from these systems? 

**Consider:**  
There are a lot of jargon terms that are used in libraries, did any in this [glossary from OCLC](https://help.oclc.org/Librarian_Toolbox/OCLC_glossaries/OCLC_glossary) come up during the activity above? As an alternative, another activity to consider is the [Jargon Busting](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/02-jargon-busting/index.html) activity from Library Carpentry. This exercise is an opportunity to begin to ask questions and to get a firmer grasp on the concepts around data, code or software development in libraries.

### Thing 10: Next steps for your library in supporting FAIR
In Thing 1 you read LIBER’s Implementing FAIR Principles: the role of Libraries. You considered what your library needed to do in order to better support FAIR data. In Thing 10 we will create a list of outstanding action items.

**Activity:**  
1. Write a list of what your library is currently doing to support and promote the FAIR Data Principles. 
2. Now compare this to the list in the LIBER document. Where are the gaps and what can you do to fill these?
3. Create an action plan to improve FAIR support at your library!

**Consider:**  
* Incorporate all that you learnt and progress that you made in “doing” this Top 10 FAIR Things!
