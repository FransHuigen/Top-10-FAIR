## Description:

So - conceptually I’m using a scratch n sniff sticker thought model to think about how to translate FAIR principles into useable concepts for research-facing support staff (eg Librarians). Scratch n sniff because these are friendly/fun ways of getting into a topic without necessarily losing yourself down a rabbit hole. 

## Audience:

Library staff who provide research support

## Goals:
* Translating FAIR speak to library speak (What is it? Why do I need to know? What do I tell researchers?)
* Help the water cooler conversation when librarians explain and argue in favour of FAIR with (discipline-specific) examples.
* Understanding FAIR data helps us be better stewards of our own resources  

# Things:

## Thing 1: Why should library staff care about FAIR?

* Because FAIR can work as a quality indicator for a Librarian making judgements about what resources to make available to their researcher clients.
* Because discussing the FAIR principles can draw the discussion away from “Open Access is a dewey-eyed utopian dream!” and toward a “Let’s use our tech powers for good!”  
* Library staff who work with data in their own work (catalogers, data archivists, IT, etc.) will have a more productive and sensible workflow
* Data are everywhere in our research environment. They look different in different
disciplines and our liaison librarians have specific expertise with these needs. Allows for discussion among different disciplines who might not think of their information as “data”.
* Providing support for researchers’ data allows for new opportunities to connect with faculty
* FAIR principles are a practical and hands-on (doing) way of engaging with researchers rather than passive (saying/lecturing)

##### Thing - How FAIR is a dataset?
**Activity:**

Go to the Australian Research Data Commons [FAIR Data Assessment tool](https://www.ands-nectar-rds.org.au/fair-tool). Now go to [re3data](re3data.org), navigate to a repository of your choice and select a dataset. Take the dataset and assess it against the FAIR data assessment tool. How FAIR was the dataset? How difficult was the assessment exercise?

If you’re looking for more resources to guide you through the specific principles, then have a look at the Australian Research Data Commons [training resources](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/fairdata/training) sorted into individual principles.

## Thing 2: Metadata and FAIR

A number of FAIR principles make reference to “metadata”... but what is metadata and how is it relevant to FAIR?

Explore the inherent biases and assumptions in how data is organized to reinforce power structures in society. 
Examples: LOC doesn’t have subject include climate change denialism or LGBTQ 

Activity:
1. View [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE): the Metadata Librarian explains metadata (3 mins)  
2. View this [metadata record](https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/koala-hospital-data) for a dataset:   
  a. Can you identify relevant date metadata? What could be improved? What is missing?
  b. What type of metadata does the FAIR principles ask for? 

## Thing 3: What’s FAIR got to DAAO, got to DAAO with it?
[DAAO](https://www.daao.org.au/) (Design and Art Australian Online) is a database which brings together biographical data about Australian artists, designers, craftspeople and curators with information about artworks, event histories and collection details from major cultural institutions and individual researchers. It’s an open collaborative tool - even you can join!

**Intentions**: this could be a great example repository for investigating the FAIRness of a ‘discipline specific’ repository. Biographical data, historical records, the “scholarly record”, linked open data technology and a crowd sourced open collaborative interface all come together in an attempt to provide new mechanisms for history-making and new knowledge creation. Disclaimer! I worked on this project as a junior data librarian in 2011, so my knowledge is slightly eroded.

**Reality**: project funding ended in 2015, the same year that the FORCE11 FAIR data principles came out. In 2018, the DAAO site has minimal user activity is hosted by UNSW in what seems to be caretaker mode, with in 2018.

Flavour: humanities/GLAM

**Findable:** the DAAO is harvested by Trove, a collections aggregator and home to diverse digitised collections run by the National Library of Australia. The DAAO database itself has a Handle identifier and 
metadata maps to common standards (EAC-CPF, RIF-CS, Dublin Core). Because the database is FAIR, metadata from different collections can be brought together for the first time, so you can make connections between creators, events, time periods and collaborative works which may not necessarily have been possible without a very large cork board, lots of string, pins and an underground bunker. 

**Accessible:** the end user licence agreement governs usage of the site’s resources. Users contributing images are encouraged to licence using CC, user guidelines 

**Interoperable:** the DAAO pulls in metadata and content from national collections and institutions, and is also harvested by HuNI. The data is expressed in RDF which enables it to be part of the linked open data promise of the semantic web! 

**Reusable:** the content on the site makes it pretty easy for not only academics but also friends, fellow artists, relatives and family historians to contribute to a reusable resource. 

Activity ideas for exploring the DAAO:
1. Watch this [short video](https://vimeo.com/90293398) about the DAAO
2. Create a contributor account and log in.
3. Find an artist or designer and add some information about them
4. Save a bunch of records of artists from your home town.

### Thing 4 -  How can personal and identifying datasets be FAIR?
Librarians in many disciplines (HaSS, Health, Medicine, Design, Science etc) may find themselves consulting on data that involves personal and identifying information and this means that Privacy Legislation (State and Federal) must be adhered to. Personal data and information may also include sensitive and/or health information, demanding an even greater duty of care. 
Yet sometimes these datasets can be the building blocks for truly life-altering research. So what to do? 

Choose some of the resources below and find as many answers as possible for how personal data can be made Findable and Accessible for Reuse. 

Overviews:
Despite being written for Human Research Ethics Committees, the [ANDS HREC guide](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/748737/HREC_Guide.pdf) is a handy overview for librarians interested in making personal data FAIR:   

This can be regarded as the ‘bible’ for Australian research practice:  NHMRC National [Statement on Ethical Conduct of Human Research](https://nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2007-updated-2018#element_4__data_collection_and_management) (2018) - CH3.1 Element 4

### Thing 5 - Protocols
For data to be accessible it should ideally be available via a standard protocol. Think in terms of borrowing a book: there are a number of expectations that the library lays out in order to proceed. You have to identify yourself using a library card, you have to bring the book to the checkout desk, and in return you walk out of the library with a demagnetised book and receipt reminding you when you have to return the book by.

Accessing the books in the library means that you must learn and abide by the rules for accessing books.

The FAIR data principles call for open, standardised protocols for accessing data via their identifier. For data providers that use DOIs, Handles, PURLs, or IGSNs that resolve to a website this comes for free. The protocol here is [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), and is achieved via a resolver.



### Thing (?) - Find out how digital libraries are FAIR or not


Criteria for determining if a digital library is FAIR: 
* Persistent identifiers 
* Open access vs. paid access 
* Provenance information / metadata 
* Author credibility
* Versioning information  
* License / reuse information
* Usage statistics (number of times downloaded)

**Activity:**
Choose one of the digital libraries listed below 
* [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
* [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/)
* [National Digital Library of India](https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/)
* [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en)
* [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/)

Complete the following steps:
* Search/browse for an item
* Does the library display reuse permissions/licenses on how to use the item?
* Is there provenance information
Instructions for use, creative/generative examples of collection use?

### Thing - Are the FAIR principles covered in your training/skills dev?
Go to existing data management/data sharing training you provide to Graduates or HDRs or other researchers and see how well the [15 FAIR principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) are covered in this training.
If you don’t have a training, have a look at training materials provided by others. 




### Thing 10 - what is the role of libraries in FAIR?
The FAIR Data Principles are essential for libraries who want to foster and extend research data services. Libraries have a strong tradition in describing resources, providing access and building collections, and providing support for the long-term stewardship of digital resources. Building on their specific knowledge and expertise librarians should feel confident with making research data FAIR. How can libraries get started with the FAIR principles? 

**Activity:**

1. Read [LIBER’s Implementing FAIR Principles: the role of Libraries](https://libereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LIBER-FAIR-Data.pdf) 
2. Write a list of what your library is currently doing to support and promote the FAIR Data Principles. Now compare this to the list in the LIBER document. Where are the gaps and what can you do to fill these?

Ideas:

Maybe there can be a Thing for the reference librarians determining if a source is FAIR, something they can indicate to a patron just in case. Could be a quick tip that they can use to determine if the source is FAIR like whether it follows an international standard like CoreTrustSeal or if it is included in FAIRsharing, the repository finder tool, re3data?

In Library Carpentry sessions, librarians are always asking about APIs in our jargon busting activities. Maybe we can include an API exercise? In Library Carpentry, there is an example of accessing the CrossRef API, you just need to feed the API with an ISSN https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/13-looking-up-data/index.html There is likeley a DataCite example as well and they can peruse the returned data, check whether they can find certain things that identify it as FAIR. 

Also, I wonder for the Things if you can indicate which principles they highlight?
